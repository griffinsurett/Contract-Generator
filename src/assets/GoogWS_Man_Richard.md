**3.6 Response and Completion Time.** Service Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to:

- Begin addressing each valid change request (such as user creation, update, deletion, or login/password assistance) within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt during Service Provider's standard business hours; and
- Either complete the requested change within that timeframe or alert Client within the same forty-eight (48) hour period if additional time, clarification, or approvals are required.

- Provide Service Provider with necessary administrative access to the Environment;
- Ensure Authorized Contacts are available to provide timely approvals and information;

## FEES & PAYMENT

**5.1 Service Fee (Includes Up to 30 Billable Users).**

In consideration for the Services, Client shall pay Service Provider a fixed monthly service fee of USD 120.00 (the "Service Fee"). The Service Fee covers management of the Environment and includes up to thirty (30) Billable Users in any given month. No additional per-user fees are charged while the Billable User Count is thirty (30) or fewer.

**5.2 Per-User Fees Above 30 Billable Users.**

(a) If, on the User Count Date for any month, the Billable User Count exceeds thirty (30), Client shall also pay a per-user monthly fee of USD 4.00 per Billable User (the "Per-User Fee") for each Billable User above thirty (30).

(b) Monthly Management Fee calculation:

- If Billable User Count ≤ 30: Monthly Management Fee = USD 120.00
- If Billable User Count > 30: Monthly Management Fee = USD 120.00 + (Billable User Count − 30) × USD 4.00

(c) For clarity, only the Service Provider Account listed in Schedule B is not counted as a Billable User when determining the Billable User Count. Owner Account(s) are counted as Billable Users if active.

**5.3 User Count Determination.**

(a) The Billable User Count for each month shall be determined as of [e.g., the last calendar day of the prior month] (the "User Count Date") using Google Workspace admin reports or equivalent administrative tools. Suspended user accounts may be counted as Billable Users if they retain active licenses.

(b) If Client does not dispute the count in writing within seven (7) days of receiving a summary, it is deemed accepted for billing.

**5.4 Invoicing & Payment Terms.**

(a) Invoiced monthly in advance.

(b) Payment due within [X] days.

(c) Late payments may accrue interest at [X]% per month (or max allowed) plus collection costs.

**5.5 Google Fees and Other Third-Party Charges.**

(a) Client is solely responsible for all Google Fees and other third-party fees, including any Google Workspace license used for the Service Provider Account.

(b) Management Fees do not include those charges.

(c) Termination/non-payment here does not relieve Client of third-party obligations.

**5.6 Taxes.** Management Fees are exclusive of taxes; Client pays applicable taxes excluding Provider income taxes.

**5.7 Rate Adjustments.**

Service Provider may adjust the Service Fee and/or Per-User Fee at any time by providing Client with at least sixty (60) days' prior written notice. Updated rates will automatically take effect at the end of the sixty (60) day notice period unless Client terminates this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.2. Client's continued use of the Services after the effective date of the revised rates constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.

## TERM & TERMINATION (AT ANY TIME)

**6.2 Termination by Client.** Client may terminate any time with thirty (30) days' notice; Client owes accrued Management Fees and all Google Fees unless/until cancelled with Google.
